<h1 align="center">🔐 Analysis of Cyber Attacks</h1>
<p align="center">Understanding attack patterns, decoding protocols, and defending digital frontiers.</p>

Cybersecurity isn't just code and firewalls—it's a constant battle of wits. This project dives deep into real-world attack traffic to uncover patterns, sniff out anomalies, and give you a clear lens into the invisible war happening over networks.

## 🧩 Problem It Solves

Attackers often disguise malicious traffic to blend in with legitimate activity. This notebook helps:
- Identify high-risk ports and suspicious protocol behavior.
- Reveal trends in attack types and volume.
- Extract meaningful insights for strengthening network defenses.

## 🏗️ Architecture / Design

This ML-powered analysis follows a clean and logical flow:
- **Data Ingestion**: Loads from `TCP-ports.csv`, sourced from `Cybersecurity_attacks.zip`.
- **Preprocessing**: Cleans and restructures for relevant features.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Visual breakdowns of attack frequency, port usage, and protocol patterns.
- **Attack Mapping & Insights**: Highlights potential intrusions and vulnerabilities based on behavior.
- **Notebook Output**: Interactive visuals, clearly labeled sections, and reproducible cells.

## 🛠️ Key Technologies Used

- **Python**: For data wrangling and visualization.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: To slice and dice the data.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For compelling charts and heatmaps.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Code + explanation = clarity.
- **GitHub**: Version control and collaboration.
